Kindly take note of these important points

1. The components folder should contain a sub-folder which should have the name of the page that component is on. For example is the Home folder I have created
2. The Pages folder in the src folder should also have a sub-folder which has the name of each respective Page
3. I have created some general styles in the index.css file. All submissions on general styles you think we could add or some modifications on the already existent general styles should be addressed to Junior.
4. Each developer is supposed to work in his/her own created branch. NB: No one should make changes to the main branch except Junior.
5. Do not forget to use the BEM naming convention to name your classes.
6. So far These are the most import rules. Lads, let's Kickstart Work :)
